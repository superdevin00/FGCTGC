Project for Senior Seminar class
Created by Devin Crabtrey
Game includes a tutorial, deckbuilder and peer-to-peer netcode
Playing online requires the host to portforward or for players to use a third party tunneling software like Hamachi or Radmin
Players can play localy by launching the game twice, setting one as host and the other to join 'localhost' (This will make both players use the same deck)
